					<h2 id="article-title">Royal Robbins: A short biography</h2>
					<p>Royal Robbins was an American rockclimber/mountaineer who was famed for his early ascents in Yosemite of iconic rock formations like half-dome and El-Capitan. 
					Robbins was at the forefront of the rise in popularity of rockclimbing as a sport. Unlike many of his contemporaries, however, how one climbed was just as important as the significance of what one climbed. During a time 
					when many climbers relied on drilling pitons into a face to aid their way up, Robbins was an advocate of <i>"clean climbing"</i>, the practice of wedging removable <i>"nuts"</i> into the features of a cliff-face to protect the climber
					in the event of a fall. Robbins would go onto document his climbing philosophy in his books, <i>Basic Rockcraft</i> and <i>Advanced Rockcraft</i></p>

					<p>Royal Robbins, born in Pleasant, W.VA, later moved to California with his mother as a teenager. Here he found his love for rockclimbing. At 17, he made the first free ascent -climbing using only ropes for safety/support- of Tahquitz Peak in the San Jacinto Mountains in California.
					His ascent of "Open Book" was at that time regarded as one of the most challenging rock-climbing feats to his day. </p>

					<p>Robbins later began taking on the big walls of Yosemite National Park. Robbins, and his partners, Jerry Galwas and Mike Sherrick made a landmark ascent of the Half-Dome in 1957. Robbins feat, however, did not go unrivaled as Warren Harding led the first team to ascend the Nose of El-Capitan.
					Harding's ascent took him 18 months of siege style climbing. Harding used fixed ropes, hammered pitons, and drilled 125 metal bolts into El-Capitan. Robbins would later go on to complete the same climb "clean" in only 7 days. Harding and Robbins soon became rivals in both climbing achievements and ethic as Harding heavily relied on fixed gear like pitons and bolts.</p>
					
					<p>Royal Robbins is often regarded as the "conscious of rockclimbing". Without someone like him to pave the way for climbing ethic in the United States, beautiful faces like El-Capitan and Half-Dome would have been defaced by climbers like who liberally used bolts and pitons.
